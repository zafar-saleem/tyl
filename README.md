<h2>Requirements</h2>
App Boilerplate requires Grunt that needs to be installed and needs, but not must, some basic knowledge of Grunt. 
If you don't know Grunt then please read about it <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">here</a>. Similarly, it also needs some bower knowledge as it is
used as dependency management tool. Please read about bower <a href="http://bower.io/">here</a>. Install both of these tools before continuing.

<h2>Usage</h2>

2. Run npm install command to install all Grunt dependencies.
3. Run bower install to install all project dependencies such as jQuery.

Once you complete making your application then run following command to build your application for production.
